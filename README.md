This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

First connect your project to git.

```bash
git init
```

then go to github.com and create a new repository on your account. You can then copy the repository link and connect it to your project by making your repository the origin:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repository-link>
```

Once it is linked, commit and push your changes to your repository. (You can do this on the left-hand side of vscode in the source control tab).

Once it has been updated on github, go back to vercel and find the giant box that says "Import Git Repository" and click import on your repository name. If you don't see your repository name, you might have to change app permissions. There is a button under the import tab that says "adjust GitHub App Permissions. You can manually select your repository to have permission to be used by vercel there.

Once you click import, you can literally just click "deploy" and it will build your application for you and give you a free domain that is publically accessbile.
